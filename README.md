# My Course Tracker

## What will this application do?

This application will keep track of all the user's marks for all their courses. The user will be able to create a new term
with all the courses that they are taking in that term. In each course, the user will be able to input the components that
makes up their total mark for that course and the weights of each individual components. This way, they are able to reliably
keep track of how they are doing in each course as they input new marks that they receive throughout the term. The user will
also be able to see what marks they are aiming for in an assignment in order to achieve the final mark that they want
(for example, I need to get at least 70% on my final to get a final mark of 80% in MATH 101.)

*Summary of what this application would do:*
- Allow user to create a new school term and input courses that they are taking.
- User can input the components that makes up the total mark for a course.
- User can input the weight of a component used to calculate the final mark.
- User can input the assignments for each of the components (for example, lab 1 would go under the component Labs) 
- User can input score/grades for each assignments throughout the school year
- User can use the program to find a certain mark that they need for an exam.

## Who will use this application?

The main audience that this application is intended for is students in high school or post-secondary as keeping track of 
marks play a big role in what the user wants to do and achieve. I believe that this application would be very useful for
a user in that situation. 

## Why does this project of interest to me?

In my limited experience with post-secondary so far is that keeping track of my own grades is a very important part as it
tells me if I need to put more effort and time into a course that I'm struggling with or if I'm on track to get the grades
that I'm aiming for to get a specific program in university. Furthermore, in UBC, most courses release grades on Canvas which
unfortunately doesn't take into account the weighted average when calculating the current grade in a course. I find myself
calculating the weighted average myself before taking a final or a midterm to see what I'm aiming for and to me, this is 
somewhat of a chore. I think it would be useful to have a program that keeps track of all my courses and tells me my current
grades correctly so I could accurately reflect on my progress.

## User Stories

*User Stories Week 1*
- As a user, I want to be able to create a new term in my academic history.
- As a user, I want to be able to add a course to my term
- As a user, I want to be able to add a component to a course
- As a user, I want to be able to add a assignment to a component 

*User Stories Week 2*
- As a user, when I select the quit option, the program will save the academic history to file (as a course tracker should).
- As a user, I want the previous data to be presented to me right away (display the user's academic history so they can interact)
