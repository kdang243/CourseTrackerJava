# UBC Course Grades Tracker 

This desktop java application allows students to keep track of their current grades in a class, including weighted average and to-do assignments in the future. This is made to be a replacement of Canvas's current grading system since it currently does not allow tracking for weighted average. 

## Functionalities
- Keeps track of all grades that you've done in your degree
- Calculates weighted average that you currently have
- Calculates what grade you need to achieve a certain score in that pesky final exam
- Everything is locally stored using JSON, you information is not uploaded anywhere else.

## Technologies
- The backbone of this project was all made in Java
- The GUI is made using Java Swing
- Unit testing was done using JUnit
